      text: "The Australian Bureau of Statistics (ABS) is Australia’s national statistical agency, providing trusted official statistics on a wide range of economic, social, population and environmental matters of importance to Australia. The role of the ABS is to provide the statistical information that Australia needs, respond to the changing information priorities of its stakeholders, enhance the ways that it interacts with its stakeholders, develop and maintain community trust, which is fundamental to its ability to collect high quality information, enable effective and safe use of its statistics, coordinate and advise official bodies on statistics, including developing, and ensuring compliance with, statistical standards, fulfil its role as an Accredited Integrating Authority, build its capacity to take advantage of opportunities, such as advances in technology, big data, and use of administrative information for statistical purposes,  ensure cost-effect operations, including better use of existing information, collect information more efficiently, streamline processes, and reduce the impact on those who provide statistical information. It is the highest priority of the ABS to deliver high quality official statistics. To ensure that the ABS can deliver relevant, trusted, objective statistics, it is transforming the ABS and partnering with stakeholders to innovate, develop and implement new statistical solutions. The ABS also has an important leadership role, coordinating statistical activities and collaborating with official bodies in the collection, compilation, analysis and distribution of statistics. In addition, the ABS provides technical advice and assistance to the Australian and state and territory governments in relation to statistics, develops standards for statistics, and helps to ensure compliance with those standards. The ABS Corporate Plan, outlining the ABS purpose, strategic priorities, operating environment and performance measures, can be found on the ABS website."

      bio: "Teresa Dickinson is the Deputy Australian Statistician leading the Census & Data Services Group.
The Census & Data Services Group is responsible for collecting the data the ABS uses in its work and disseminating the official statistics, data and insights it produces to inform Australia's important decisions. The Group provides statistical infrastructure to support work of the ABS and leads its work to expand and improve data sharing, data integration and microdata access across government. It also leads planning underway for the 2021 Census.
Teresa joined the ABS in April 2018 after four years as a Deputy Government Statistician and Deputy Chief Executive at Statistics New Zealand. At Stats NZ she held a variety of roles, including leading their transformation program, providing statistical infrastructure and – most recently - leading data collection and production of official statistics and insights across economic, social and environmental statistics. This included responsibility for leading their 2018 Census, which was undertaken in March.
During a career spanning 30 years, Teresa has worked in a wide range of statistical and data roles in the public sector including Commonwealth Government (AIHW and ABS previously), Victorian State Government and scientific research (CSIRO). She has over 15 years’ experience at senior executive levels.
Teresa holds Master of Statistics and a Master of Business Administration degrees. She is a University Medallist and Accredited Statistician with the Statistical Society of Australia."

      bio: "Dr Moreno-Betancur is a Senior Research Fellow in Biostatistics and part of the management team of the Victorian Centre for Biostatistics (ViCBiostat), a collaboration of researchers across three institutions (Murdoch Children’s Research Institute, The University of Melbourne and Monash University).
After a BSc in Pure Mathematics at Universidad de los Andes (Bogota) and an MSc in Statistics at Université Pierre et Marie Curie (Paris), Dr Moreno-Betancur obtained a PhD in Biostatistics from Université Paris-Sud (Paris). Prior to arriving in Melbourne, she held a postdoctoral role at the French Epidemiology Centre on Medical Causes of Death (Inserm CépiDc).
Her research concerns the development of statistical methods for the analysis of clinical and population health studies, with focus on the areas of survival analysis, causal inference and missing data. Her work is strongly motivated by analytical issues arising in studies on which she collaborates, particularly in child and adolescent health.
