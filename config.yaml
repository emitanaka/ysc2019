The Census & Data Services Group is responsible for collecting the data the ABS uses in its work and disseminating the official statistics, data and insights it produces to inform Australia's important decisions. The Group provides statistical infrastructure to support work of the ABS and leads its work to expand and improve data sharing, data integration and microdata access across government. It also leads planning underway for the 2021 Census.
Teresa joined the ABS in April 2018 after four years as a Deputy Government Statistician and Deputy Chief Executive at Statistics New Zealand. At Stats NZ she held a variety of roles, including leading their transformation program, providing statistical infrastructure and – most recently - leading data collection and production of official statistics and insights across economic, social and environmental statistics. This included responsibility for leading their 2018 Census, which was undertaken in March.
During a career spanning 30 years, Teresa has worked in a wide range of statistical and data roles in the public sector including Commonwealth Government (AIHW and ABS previously), Victorian State Government and scientific research (CSIRO). She has over 15 years’ experience at senior executive levels.
Teresa holds Master of Statistics and a Master of Business Administration degrees. She is a University Medallist and Accredited Statistician with the Statistical Society of Australia."

      photo: "/img/margarita.png"
      bio: "Dr Moreno-Betancur is a Senior Research Fellow in Biostatistics and part of the management team of the Victorian Centre for Biostatistics (ViCBiostat), a collaboration of researchers across three institutions (Murdoch Children’s Research Institute, The University of Melbourne and Monash University).
After a BSc in Pure Mathematics at Universidad de los Andes (Bogota) and an MSc in Statistics at Université Pierre et Marie Curie (Paris), Dr Moreno-Betancur obtained a PhD in Biostatistics from Université Paris-Sud (Paris). Prior to arriving in Melbourne, she held a postdoctoral role at the French Epidemiology Centre on Medical Causes of Death (Inserm CépiDc).
Her research concerns the development of statistical methods for the analysis of clinical and population health studies, with focus on the areas of survival analysis, causal inference and missing data. Her work is strongly motivated by analytical issues arising in studies on which she collaborates, particularly in child and adolescent health.
