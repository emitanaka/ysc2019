We would encourage any participants to find their own accomodation at Canberra. There are several accomodaton options around Manuka Oval and it is best to lock in your accomodation as soon as possible.  
	
Meanwhile, we have an exclusive offer for our delegates for the special rate of $165 (instead of $175).  The Forrest Hotel and Apartments is 11 minutes walking distance from Manuka Oval.
