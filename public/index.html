<div style="font-size:14pt;line-height:1.5">
Why not combine your trip to the conference with a little holiday, and explore Canberra to experience Australian culture and history at superb monuments and galleries?  Our beautiful capital is a city surrounded by parkland and native bush and Spring is the perfect time for a visit.

As the home of Australia’s Parliament House, Canberra plays host to a community of residents who've relocated from larger cities such as Melbourne and Sydney to work in politics, government and related industries such as media. Add a large student population (Australia's prestigious Australian National University and Canberra University are located here) and a number of renowned galleries and museums, and the result is a small but cosmopolitan city with a great food scene and plenty of creative flair.

<p style="font-size: 24 pt">Floriade</p>
YSC2019 is timed perfectly so that delegates have the opportunity to experience Australia’s biggest celebration of spring: Floriade. This iconic Canberra event will run from Saturday 14 September until Sunday 13 October 2019. Floriade is more than thousands of flowers.

<p style="font-size: 24 pt">How to get to Canberra</p>
There are frequent domestic flights from major Australian capital cities to Canberra. It is only an easy three-hour drive from Sydney and an eight-hour drive from Melbourne. There are plenty of scenic routes if you like to get off the beaten track and visit one of the many country towns along the way.
