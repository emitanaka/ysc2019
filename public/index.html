There will be two pre-conference workshops held in parallel on September 30, the day before
the conference.
</div>
<br>

<h4>Workshop 1: Communicating with R Markdown</h4>
<div style="font-size:14pt;line-height:1.5">

<b>About the workshop</b><br>
A workshop for R Markdown users who want to get more out of R Markdown (and friends).
In this workshop, we will demystify how R Markdown works under the hood. You will learn
practical tools and workflows to increase your efficiency and productivity using R Markdown
(including RStudio IDE features and templates), while learning how to use some extension
packages along the way. We assume that you have knit an R Markdown document before, but
you don’t need to be an advanced R Markdown user to take this workshop.
<br>
<b>About the presenter</b>

<b>About the workshop</b>
<br>
This one-day workshop will have two components. First, it will provide an overview of the
wide variety of data sources from the Australian Bureau of Statistics that are available for
analysts. These sources include our 5-yearly Census, survey data, administrative data, and in
particular, linked data. A demonstration of the ABS Table Builder and Data Lab products -
platforms for analysts to remotely undertake bespoke analyses using ABS data - will be given. Several case studies will provide examples of the many innovative ways analysts are
making use of ABS data for their projects. Second, it will focus on how Table Builder can
produce data-cubes for a standard analysis in R. This will then extend to creating large data-
cubes suitable for mixed models using the ‘LME4’ package in R. This second component of
the workshop will conclude with discussion of Poisson-gamma models, which have
additional advantages in this type of data framework.

        <h2 class="section-title">About Canberra</h2>

<div style="font-size:14pt;line-height:1.5">
Why not combine your trip to the conference with a little holiday, and explore Canberra to experience Australian culture and history at superb monuments and galleries?  Our beautiful capital is a city surrounded by parkland and native bush and Spring is the perfect time for a visit.

As the home of Australia’s Parliament House, Canberra plays host to a community of residents who've relocated from larger cities such as Melbourne and Sydney to work in politics, government and related industries such as media. Add a large student population (Australia's prestigious Australian National University and Canberra University are located here) and a number of renowned galleries and museums, and the result is a small but cosmopolitan city with a great food scene and plenty of creative flair.

<p style="font-size: 24 pt">Floriade</p>
YSC2019 is timed perfectly so that delegates have the opportunity to experience Australia’s biggest celebration of spring: Floriade. This iconic Canberra event will run from Saturday 14 September until Sunday 13 October 2019. Floriade is more than thousands of flowers. Click here to see what it’s all about: <a href="https://floriadeaustralia.com/event-info/">https://floriadeaustralia.com/event-info/</a> 


<p style="font-size: 24 pt">How to get to Canberra</p>
There are frequent domestic flights from major Australian capital cities to Canberra. It is only an easy three-hour drive from Sydney and an eight-hour drive from Melbourne. There are plenty of scenic routes if you like to get off the beaten track and visit one of the many country towns along the way.
