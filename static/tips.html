<h1>Presentation Tips</h1>
	<p>As a conference presenter, you would always maintain the highest standard in presentation. The following are some tips to create a better presentation. </p>
	<h2>Before the Presentation</h2>
	<h3>Organising content</h3>
	<ul>
		<li>Make sure the audience walks away understanding the following:</li>
		<ul>
			<li>The problem and why it is a problem</li>
			<li>What has been done about the problem</li>
			<li>What you are doing (or have done) about the problem</li>
			<li>The value your approach provides</li>
		</ul>
		<li>Next steps</li>
		<ul>
			<li>Describe the problem clearly enough for the audience to appreciate the value of your contribution.</li>
			<li>Present your contribution clearly.</li>
			<li>Aim your presentation at an audience that is not familiar with your research area so you communicate the importance of your work, rather than simply laying out the results.</li>
			<li>Provide references and your contact information.</li>
		</ul>
	</ul>
	<h3>Preparing effective displays</h3>
	<ul>
		<li>Keep it simple so you don't distract from your research.</li>
		<li>Use at least 24-point type.</li>
		<li>Do not use a photocopy of a standard printed page as a display.</li>
		<li>Summarise your main points.</li>
		<li>Limit your material to eight lines per slide.</li>
		<li>Limit tables to four rows/columns.</li>
		<li>Display large tables as graphs.</li>
		<li>Avoid numerous curves on a graphical display.</li>
		<li>Label graphs clearly with big, readable type.</li>
		<li>Use easy-to-read fonts such as Arial.</li>
		<li>Use light letters (e.g., yellow or white) on a dark background (e.g., dark blue) when displaying your material on an LCD projector.</li>
		<li>Use equations sparingly and concentrate on what your results mean.</li>
		<li>Keep a large margin on all sides of your slide.</li>
		<li>Identify the journal when you give references.</li>
		<li>Preview your presentation.</li>
	</ul>		
	<h3>Timing your talk</h3>
	<ul>
		<li>Present one slide per minute.</li>
		<li>Talk at a pace that everybody in the audience can understand.</li>
		<li>Budget your time to take a minute or two less than your maximum allotment.</li>
		<li>Practice your talk.</li>
	</ul>
	<h2>During the Presentation</h2>
	<ul>
		<li>Check to make sure the microphone works before you begin.</li>
		<li>Be sure everyone in the room can see your material.</li>
		<li>Don't apologise for your displays (create them properly in the first place).</li>
		<li>Don't apologise for incomplete results.</li>
	</ul>
	<h2>After the Presentation</h2>
	<ul>
		<li>Thank the audience for its attention.</li>
		<li>Gather your materials and move off quickly to allow the next presenter to prepare.</li>
		<li>Stay for the entire session and, afterward, be available for people to ask you questions.</li>
	</ul>
